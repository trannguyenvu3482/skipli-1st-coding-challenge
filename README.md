# Skipli 1st Coding Challenge - Vu Tran

## About the project:
### Client:
- Technologies: ReactJS, Material UI and React Toastify for UI, Axios for fetching
### Server:
- Technologies: NodeJS, Express, Firebase Firestore as main database
- Notes:
  + Free Twilio trial accounts can only send message to verified numbers so it can only be sent to my phone n.o for now
  + Twilio and Firebase API key is needed so it may not work when running this project, I'm still trying to resolve this issue
